<h2>🚀 Overview</h2>

This project is a fully responsive blood donation portal that allows donors to register their details and needers to search for donors by area/location.  
All user data and donor details are handled using **Firebase Authentication & Firestore**, while donor images are stored securely via **Cloudinary**.

The project is built using pure frontend + cloud services, making it fast, scalable, and easy to deploy.

<h2>🧠 Why I Built This Project (Recruiter-Friendly)</h2>

I created this project to solve a real-world problem:  
People often struggle to find blood donors quickly during medical emergencies.

**My goals were to:**

- Build a practical, meaningful project that helps real users
- Learn and apply Firebase Authentication & Firestore database
- Use Cloudinary for real production-style image handling
- Implement responsive UI using Bootstrap
- Strengthen my JavaScript fundamentals, form validation & user flows
- Design a full end-to-end system without a traditional backend, using cloud services only

This showcases my skills in building functional, scalable, cloud-connected applications.
